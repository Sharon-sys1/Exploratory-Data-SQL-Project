# Layoffs Data Analysis Project (SQL + Excel)

## Project Overview

This project showcases an exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted on a dataset of company layoffs using SQL. The dataset was examined to uncover trends across industries, companies, and countries, with a focus on total layoffs. The project highlights real-world data insights relevant to workforce dynamics and economic changes over time.

## Objectives

- Analyse layoffs by company, industry, and country

- Understand trends in layoffs over time

- Identify companies and industries most affected

- Practice and demonstrate SQL querying skills

## Tools & Technologies

- SQL Server

- Excel (for initial dataset review)

- SQL: aggregate functions, filtering, grouping, ordering

## Key Analyses Performed

- Initial Exploration

- Queried the layoffs_staging2 table

- Focused on total_laid_off metric for consistent analysis

- Company-Level Analysis

- Identified companies with the most layoffs

- Highlighted cases where 100% of staff were laid off (e.g., company shutdowns)

- Industry Trends

- Grouped layoffs by industry to find which sectors were most impacted

- Observed high layoffs in consumer and transportation sectors

- Timeline Analysis

- Used MIN(date) and MAX(date) to find layoff time range

- Noted that layoffs began in 2020 (pandemic onset) and peaked years later

- Geographic Impact

- Grouped data by country to understand regional differences

## Insights Summary

- The most affected industries included consumer and transportation sectors.

- Some companies laid off their entire workforce.

- Layoffs sharply increased in 2020 and continued to rise in the following years.

- Countries with large tech and startup sectors saw higher overall layoffs.

## What I Learned

- Improved my ability to write complex SQL queries
